# Half-Mine

Half-Mine is a sound pack that aims to make a fully playable version of Minecraft using authentic Half-Life sound effects. This means no obnoxious memes to avoid being a gimmicky pack that users might download once and then disable afterwards. This pack currently does not alter anything visually.
